    "### Artificial intelligence\n",
    "- born in 1950s\n",
    "- *the effort to automate intellectual tasks normally performed by humans*\n",
    "- old approach: **symbolic AI** -> new approach: **machine learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Machine Learning\n",
    "Machine learning arises from this question: could a computer go beyond “what we know how to order it to perform” and learn on its own how to perform a specified task? Could a computer surprise us? Rather than programmers crafting data-processing rules by hand, could a computer automatically learn these rules by looking at data?\n",
    "![machine learning][ml]\n",
    "\n",
    "A machine-learning system is *trained* rather than explicitly programmed\n",
    "\n",
    "### Learning representations from data\n",
    "To do machine learning, we need three things:\n",
    "- Input data points\n",
    "- Examples of the expected output\n",
    "- A way to measure whether the algorithm is doing a good job\n",
    "\n",
    "The central problem in machine learning and deep learning is to meaningfully transform data: in other words, to learn useful **representations** of the input data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is arepresentation ?\n",
    "For instance, a color image can be encoded in the RGB format or in the HSV format: these are two different\n",
    "representations of the same data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some tasks that may be difficult with one representation can become easy with another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine-learning models are all about finding appropriate representations for their input data—transformations of the data that make it more amenable to the task at hand, such as a classification task.\n",
    "\n",
    "All machine-learning algorithms consist of automatically finding such transformations that turn data into more-useful representations for a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "Machine-learning algorithms aren’t usually creative in finding these transformations; they’re merely searching through a predefined set of operations, called a **hypothesis space**\n",
    "\n",
    "-> **Machine Learning** is:  searching for useful representations of some input data, within a predefined space of possibilities, using guidance from a feedback signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deep Learning\n",
    "How many layers contribute to a model of the data is\n",
    "called the **depth** of the model. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Deep Learning**: is a mathematical framework for learning representations from data. Technically, it is a multistage way to learn data representations.\n",

    "- Near-human-level speech recognition\n",
    "- Near-human-level handwriting transcription\n",
    "- Improved machine translation\n",
    "- Improved text-to-speech conversion\n",
